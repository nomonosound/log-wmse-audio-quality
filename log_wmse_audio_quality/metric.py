    A custom audio metric, logWMSE, that tries to fix a few shortcomings of common metrics.
    The most important property is the support for digital silence in the target, which
    (SI-)SDR, SIR, SAR, ISR, VISQOL_audio, STOI, CDPAM and VISQOL do not support.

    MSE is well-defined for digital silence targets, but has a bunch of other issues:
    * The values are commonly ridiculously small, like between 1e-8 and 1e-3, which
        makes number formatting and sight-reading hard
    * It’s not tailored for audio
    * It’s not scale-invariant
    * It doesn’t align with frequency sensitivity of human hearing
    * It’s not invariant to tiny errors that don’t matter because humans can’t hear
        those errors anyway
    * It’s not logarithmic, like human hearing is

    So this custom metric attempts to solve all the problems mentioned above.
    It's essentially the log of a frequency-weighted MSE, with a few bells and whistles.
